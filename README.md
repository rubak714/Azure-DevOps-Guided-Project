# Continuous Delivery and DevOps with Azure-DevOps

Azure DevOps project will be created and setup, and teams will be added to the project; the projectâ€™s boards will be created, imported, and managed and different views of work items will be customized, and explored , and organized into sprints

# Objectives

- setting up an Azure DevOps project
- creating teams and invite coworkers to your project
- creating and importing work items in Azure DevOps Boards
- customizing project's boards, and organize work items
- planning and managing workloads using backlogs and sprints

To support teams to move towards continuous delivery and DevOps, I need a tool suite that helps me deliver software in a reliable, automated, secure and compliant way. Microsoft provides such a toolset which is called Azure DevOps. Continuous Delivery and DevOps with Azure DevOps: The Big Picture, I will get an overview of how to use the Azure DevOps tools to implement continuous delivery and DevOps. First, I will start with Azure DevOps boards, where I will explore how to support team in their agile way of work. I will look at work items, product backlogs, sprint backlogs, and how to visualize teams work on a variety of boards. Next, I will go over Azure DevOps Repos and then specifically at Git repos. Azure DevOps Git is just Git, and you will look at some additions they provide like branch policies and pull requests that help you with implementing compliance. Then, i will discover Azure DevOps pipelines. Pipelines provide a way to build and deploy software. Finally, I will learn the use of Azure DevOps artifacts and look at how I can control packages that are consumed from outside your organizational boundaries like, e.g., NPM, or Nuget Packages. After taking this project, you have a clear overview of what the Azure DevOps tools can do for me and how I can use them to implement continuous delivery and DevOps in any organization.
