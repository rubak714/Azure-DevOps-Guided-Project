To support teams to move towards continuous delivery and DevOps, you need a tool suite that helps you deliver software in a reliable, automated, secure and compliant way. Microsoft provides such a toolset which is called Azure DevOps. In this course, Continuous Delivery and DevOps with Azure DevOps: The Big Picture, you will get an overview of how to use the Azure DevOps tools to implement continuous delivery and DevOps. First, you will start with Azure DevOps boards, where you will explore how to support your team in their agile way of work. You will look at work items, product backlogs, sprint backlogs, and how to visualize your teams work on a variety of boards. Next, you will go over Azure DevOps Repos and then specifically at Git repos. Azure DevOps Git is just Git, and you will look at some additions they provide like branch policies and pull requests that help you with implementing compliance. Then, you will discover Azure DevOps pipelines. Pipelines provide a way to build and deploy your software. Finally, you will learn the use of Azure DevOps artifacts and look at how you can control packages that are consumed from outside your organizational boundaries like, e.g., NPM, or Nuget Packages. After taking this course, you will have a clear overview of what the Azure DevOps tools can do for you and how you can use them to implement continuous delivery and DevOps in your organization.
